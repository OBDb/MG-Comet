    description: "The MG Comet EV represents the British-origin (now Chinese-owned) brand's entry into the micro-electric vehicle segment, particularly targeting urban mobility in markets like India. Based on the Wuling Air EV platform from MG's parent company SAIC, it features a distinctive boxy design with a modern flair, characterized by its compact dimensions, vertical styling elements, and full-width LED light bars front and rear. Measuring just 2.9 meters in length, it's one of the smallest four-seater electric vehicles on the market, designed specifically for congested urban environments. Powered by a 17.3 kWh battery pack and a front-mounted electric motor producing approximately 41 horsepower and 110 Nm of torque, the Comet offers a claimed range of approximately 230 kilometers (143 miles) on a single charge. Charging options include a standard 3.3 kW charger that can replenish the battery in approximately 7 hours. Despite its diminutive exterior, the interior features a surprisingly spacious 2+2 seating configuration with a minimalist dashboard dominated by two 10.25-inch screensâ€”one serving as the instrument cluster and the other as the infotainment system with connectivity features including Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Standard features include automatic climate control, keyless entry, and various connected car technologies accessible through a smartphone app. Safety equipment includes dual front airbags, ABS with EBD, and rear parking sensors. The MG Comet positions itself as an accessible entry point to electric vehicle ownership with a focus on efficient, practical urban transportation rather than long-distance travel or high performance. As the first generation of this model, it represents MG's strategy to expand into emerging EV markets with affordable, city-focused electric vehicles that address specific urban mobility challenges."
